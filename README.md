# Overview

The **Timer** application is a versatile timer that allows users to set customizable durations for preparation, exercise, and rest periods. Users can specify how long they want to prepare for their workout, how long each exercise should last, the rest duration between exercises, and how many times to repeat the exercise cycle. This software is particularly useful for fitness enthusiasts looking to structure their workout routines effectively.

The purpose of creating this software is to provide an easy-to-use tool for managing workout intervals, helping users stay on track and improve their overall fitness routines.
